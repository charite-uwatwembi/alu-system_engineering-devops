A web server is a software program that serves HTTP requests made by clients, such as web browsers, and delivers the requested web pages or resources in response. It listens for incoming requests on a specific network port (usually port 80 for HTTP or port 443 for HTTPS) and responds with the appropriate HTTP status code and content. Web servers can also handle other protocols and perform additional tasks like load balancing, caching, and handling security protocols.
